# Automated-Deep-Learning-Classifier
Creating an automated Image Classifier.
# User can input something they want to classify, and by running Google Image Scraper (they can input how many numebers of image they want, 400 suggested)
# Then by running baseline code or ResNeXt or MnasNet code for training your deep learning model.
See requirements.txt for downloading librarys
This is an Automated Image Classifer by combining Scrapers and DL models
For Scrapers, it get images from google images through Selenium
And for deep learning CV models, there are a baseline for testing the general accuracy.
Then, I applied transfer learning concepts and fine-tuning the parameters from Pre-trained ResNeXt, MnasNet.
And a testing result of butterfly classification are reported in Result Folder.
